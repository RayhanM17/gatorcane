# Project: Mitigating Hurricane Damage in Southeast Florida

---

This project dives deep into how varying local building codes in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties affect **hurricane damage**, offering crucial insights from an extensive analysis of almost 500,000 FEMA payments made after Hurricanes Frances, Wilma, and Irma. We pinpointed the municipalities with the **most effective building codes** (Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Coconut Creek, and Hillsboro Beach) and those with the **least effective** (Lauderhill, Lauderdale Lakes, and Hialeah). Our core recommendation? That local governments adopt the building codes or regulatory strategies from these high-performing areas to significantly boost **future hurricane resilience**.
